# PURPOSE:
# This file configures the robot client for asynchronous inference using the LeRobot framework.
# It is responsible for:
# 1. Interfacing with the physical robot hardware (follower arm, cameras).
# 2. Connecting to the remote Policy Server to request actions based on observations.
# 3. executing the received actions on the robot.
#
# Configuration includes:
# - Policy settings (model path, type)
# - Server connection details
# - Robot hardware specifications (ports, camera indices)

# Configuration for lerobot.async_inference.robot_client
